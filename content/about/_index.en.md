      The OpenStack Korea Community began in February 2011 and was officially recognized as a community by the OpenStack Foundation in September 2012. Since then, it has grown alongside OpenStack, the open-source software platform for building cloud infrastructure.

      In October 2020, the foundation changed its name to the Open Infrastructure Foundation. In alignment with this change, the Korean community also adopted the official name "Open Infrastructure Korea User Group."

      The community engages in a wide range of activities, including providing online community and documentation services, organizing seminars and conferences, and running study groups, research projects, and development initiatives related to OpenStack and other open-source technologies.

  heading: "Open Infrastructure"
  description: "Open Infrastructure refers to cloud infrastructure built on open-source technologies. It represents an approach to building and managing IT resources—such as data centers, cloud services, networking, and storage—using open standards and open-source tools. It offers flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency while allowing organizations to independently build their own cloud infrastructure.

This concept is closely associated with open-source cloud projects such as OpenStack, Kubernetes, Ceph, and Terraform."
