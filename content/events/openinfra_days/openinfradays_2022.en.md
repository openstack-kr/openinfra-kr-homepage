summary: >
    OpenInfra & Cloud Native Day Korea 2022 is a local open source infrastructure community event jointly hosted by the OpenStack, Kubernetes, OCP, and Ceph communities.


    The 2022 event will finally bring community members together in person, breaking away from the long series of online events. We hope that this in-person event, the first in three years, will provide an opportunity to experience various technologies related to Open Infrastructure in one place, discuss them, and share insights.
